This is the code that changed my perspective of IT 
## <heading - Description>Homework
The problem-The university struggling with isolating the students and lecturers apart so this is the program that attempted to solve the problem in a way that they were sorted using an array
There were classes added namely,person,student,lecturer,arrayList and the test class
The person class is the super class which will be used to extend the other two classes-student and lecturer.
The two separate classes will be used to store information that is unique to each person so that it can later be sorted using the arrayList class
This program changed my perspective and further gave me the excitement because i initially did not know that any and every problem can be solved seamlessly before approaching this problem
